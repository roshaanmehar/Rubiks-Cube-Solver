ALGORITHM FixCubeConfiguration:
    Input: Six 3x3 matrices representing the cube faces (white, red, green, yellow, orange, blue)
    Output: Valid cube configuration or failure message

    // Start with white face as reference
    // Check white-face corners in clockwise order
    FOR each corner connected to white face:
        WHILE corner is invalid:
            // Try rotating adjacent faces (not white) first
            FOR each adjacent face in the corner:
                IF face is not white:
                    Rotate face clockwise
                    IF all corners checked so far are valid:
                        BREAK // Move to next corner
                    ELSE:
                        Rotate face back // Try another face
            
            // If no adjacent face rotation works, rotate white face
            IF corner is still invalid:
                Rotate white face clockwise
                // After rotating white, we need to recheck all previous corners
                GO BACK to first corner and recheck
    
    // Check edges connected to white face
    FOR each edge connected to white face:
        WHILE edge is invalid:
            // Similar rotation strategy as with corners
            // Try rotating adjacent faces first, then white if needed
    
    // After white face corners and edges are valid, move to middle layer
    FOR each edge in middle layer:
        WHILE edge is invalid:
            // Try rotating adjacent faces
            // This is more complex as we need to preserve white face validity
    
    // Finally, check yellow face
    // For yellow face, we primarily rotate yellow face to fix issues
    FOR each corner and edge connected to yellow face:
        WHILE corner/edge is invalid:
            Rotate yellow face clockwise
            IF after 3 rotations still invalid:
                // Problem cannot be fixed by just rotating yellow
                // Try rotating adjacent faces
    
    // Generate final cube string in URFDLB order
    RETURN cube string if valid, or failure message
